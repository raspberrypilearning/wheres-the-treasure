## Challenge: Make it harder

Are you finding the game too easy? Why not make it harder.

You could show the coin for less time. `sleep(2)` shows the coin for 2 seconds. What about `sleep(0.5)`?

Or how about confusing the player by making all the pixels turn yellow before they get to pick the location? Use `sense.clear(Y)` to fill the screen with yellow coins after showing the player where the coin is hidden, you'll also need `sleep(1)` or however many seconds you want to show the yellow screen for.
