## Увод:

In this project you will use the joystick and LED Matrix on the Sense HAT to play a memory game. The Sense HAT will show a gold coin and you have to remember where it was and use the joystick to find the hidden treasure.

To play the game press Run and watch to see where the yellow dot appears - this is the treasure! Then use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the white dot to where you think the treasure is hidden. When you get there, press return. You'll see a green dot if you were correct and a red dot if you got it wrong. You'll get 10 tries and then a score out of 10.

Note that when you are using the Sense HAT emulator you use the arrow keys and return instead of the joystick on the Sense HAT.

## Увод:

In this project, children will learn how to use the Sense HAT joystick to create a memory game. The Sense HAT shows a gold coin and you have to remember where it was and use the joystick to find the hidden treasure.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Where's the Treasure?' Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/treasure-go](http://jumpto.cc/treasure-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

* [‘Where's the Treasure’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/79ac6a377d](https://trinket.io/python/79ac6a377d)

## Offline Resources

This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* treasure/treasure.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* treasure-finished/treasure.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* Sense HAT joystick;
* Boolean logic;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

* Customize the game - use different colours or add text messages. 
* Make it harder - show the coin for less time or confuse players by filling the display with coins after showing the hidden coin.
